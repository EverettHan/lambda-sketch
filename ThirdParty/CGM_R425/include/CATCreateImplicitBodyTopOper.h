  * The Scalar Field expression (SFDag spec) to be associated with the ImplicitSurface

  * expression should not be assembled by hand but built with the CATImplicitExpressionBuilder.
  * All you do via this builder object will work on the long term, while the expression
  * themselves as encoded in the CATUnicodeString should be considered as opaque encoding
  * that might have several versions in the future (although they should remain fairly
  * readable for convenience). To navigate and query expression check the CATImplicitExpressionQuery
  * facade.
  *
  * Note: When the CATBuildExplicitPolyBody operator will be called the specified
  * expression will be modified to ensure you get an intersection of what is
  * expressed via the provided expression and the cavity volume as well as a blending
  * of that scalar field with the contact faces of that cavity. All faces of that volume
  * that are also faces of other volumes of the partitioned body are considered contact
  * faces while all faces unique to the cavity volume are considered not to be contact faces.
  * So you don't have to express yourself these intersection and blending in the expression
  * that you assemble but in situations where you would like to express more specific treatments
  * that do involve the cavity shape (or any other CGM Geometry by the way) you should
  * use the SetDependency mechanism to set these dependencies with the associated expressionId
  * that you plan to use to refer to them in your expression.
  * Please note that in the case in which you want to do very specific stuff with the cavity shape
  * even if you want to apply the same treatment to several cavity as of today you will thus have
  * to assemble those specific expression and dependency set cavity per cavity. If on the other
  * hand your expression is independent of the specific shape of the domain on which it is evaluated
  * then you can obviously associate your unique expression and it's set of dependencies to several volume.
