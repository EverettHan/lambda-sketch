  // **** 2 complementary ways to define the shape of the SweepDraft ****
  //
  // 1. Define a global profile (constant SweepDraft) and/or local profiles (variable SweepDraft) at specified locations.
  // In this case, all the profiles have to contain the same number of linear segments to define as many variable strips,
  // and the sign of all the angles associated to one strip has to be constant ...
  // ... to define the side (left or right) of the strip according to the wire orientation and the draft direction
  // No way in this mode to associate any offset plane as target for any strip.
  //
  // 2. Define successive strips (historic definition for constant angular SweepDraft only)
  // This way allows to define 2 modes for each strip : "by Length" or "Up to" an offset plane from the original one.
  // Strips can be defined in addition to global and/or local profiles previously defined according to 1.
