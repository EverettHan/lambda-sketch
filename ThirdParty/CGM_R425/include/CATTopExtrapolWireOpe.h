/**
* Class defining the topological operator to extrapol a wire.
* <br>
* The operator produces a wire topology result of the extrapolation of the input wire.
* The user can customize the extrapolation with the Setxxx methods to
*<ul>
* <li> define the type of continuity : tangency or curvature. 
* <li> define the extremity from which the extrapolation starts.
* <li> define the length of extrapolation or the body to reach.
*</ul>
* <p>
* When no support is defined, 
* the extrapolation in curvature "up to" is only possible if the body to reach is a wire and a plane; 
* the extrapolation in curvature of a given length is the extrapolated wire relimited by the plane
* created at the given length from the chosen extremity.
* When a support is defined, 
* the extrapolation in curvature is only possible on the faces with same geometry. 
*</p>
* This operator follows the general scheme of the topological operators:
* <ul>
*<li> Create the operator with the <tt>CATCreateTopExtrapolWireOpe</tt> global function.
*<li> Set the extrapolation parameters: continuity, extremity, length...
*<li> Run with the <tt>Run</tt> method. 
*<li> Get the result body by the <tt>GetResult</tt> method. 
*<li> Delete the operator with the usual C++ <tt>delete</tt> operator after use.
*</ul>
