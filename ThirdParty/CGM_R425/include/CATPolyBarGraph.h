/**
 * Graph of nodes and bars.  
 *
 * In a mathematical graph, the nodes would be referred to as vertices and the bars to as edges of the graph.  
 * However in this data structure, the names of nodes and bars replace those of vertices and edges to distinguish 
 * them from the vertices of meshes and the edges of the polyhedral model.
 *
 * In the bar graph, an adjacency relation is maintained among the bars around a node. Adjacency is kept by sorting
 * the bars around each node. Two bars are adjacent if there is a link between the two bars around the node. 
 * A bar may be adjacent to at most two bars around a node where it is linked to a previous and to a next bar. 
 *
 * A set of incident bars that are linked around a node defines a fan. 
 * A fan is open if its first and last bars are not linked to a previous and next bars respectively. 
 * A fan is closed when it is composed only of adjacent bars. 
 * There may be several open and closed fans around a node.
 *
 * The nodes and the bars have integer indices that start at 1.
