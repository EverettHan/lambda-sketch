/**
 * Class defining a topological operator that creates a spline body.
 * WARNING - If we build a spline on a support shell and part of it isn't G1 continuous, i.e.
 *           the normals to the faces aren't continous at the boundaries of the faces, the 
 *           result will be unpredictable.
 *
 *<br> This operator follows the general scheme of the topological operators.
 * For a basic use, use directly the global function
 * <tt>CATCreateTopSpline</tt>, that directly returns the resulting body.
 * If you need to tune specific parameters, use the advanced scheme:
 * <ul>
 *<li> Create the operator with the global function <tt>CATCreateTopSplineOperator</tt>
 *<li> Set parameters
 *<li> Run
 *<li> Get the resulting body
 *<li> Delete the operator with the usual C++ <tt>delete</tt> operator.
 *</ul>
 *<br> Constaints can be imposed on each points in the following way:
  *<dl>
 *<dt>0<dt><dd>no constraint, neither on the tangent, nor on the curvature.
 *<dt>1<dt><dd>the direction of the tangent is imposed.
 *<dt>2<dt><dd>the tangent is imposed.
 *<dt>4<dt><dd>the tangent and the direction of the curvature are imposed.
 *<dt>6<dt><dd>the tangent and the curvature are imposed.
 *</dl>
