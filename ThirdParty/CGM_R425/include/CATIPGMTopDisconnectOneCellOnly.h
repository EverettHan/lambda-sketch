/**
 * Class defining the operator which disconnects one cell only, of the input body,  by the given operand.
 * If the operand doesn't intersect the cell to disconnect, the returned result is the input body.
 * <br>
 * The <tt>CATIPGMTopDisconnectOneCellOnly</tt> operator follows the global frame of the topological operators 
 * and satisfies the smart mechanism: the input bodies are not modified. The resulting body is equal to 
 * the first input body, or is a new created body, possibly sharing data with the input bodies.
 * <ul>
 * <li>A <tt>CATIPGMTopDisconnectOneCellOnly</tt> operator is created with the <tt>CATCreateDisconnectOneCellOnly</tt>
 * global function: It must be directly deleted after use with the usual C++ <tt>delete</tt> operator. 
 * It is not streamable. 
 * <li>The result is accessed with the <tt>GetResult</tt> method. If you do not want 
 * to keep the resulting body, use the @href CATICGMContainer#Remove method to remove it from the 
 * geometry factory. 
 * </ul>

   * Retrieves the original data as parents of a given result cell, after disconnection

   *    a CATCell respecting the disconnection dimension and belonging to the result CATBody
   *    Only one type is expected here according to the operation definition:
   *         CATVolumeType if the operation consists in partitioning the matter of a volumic body
   *         CATFaceType if the operation consists in partitioning a surfacic body or the outer/inner shell of a volumic body

   *    The pointer to the single parent CATCell belonging to the input body to disconnect
   *    with the same dimension than iResultCell (CATVolume or CATFace)

   *         1. The original CATCell is untouched by the operation, then reused in the result body: iResultCell = oOriginalCell

   *         3. The original CATCell is subdivided into several result CATCell
   * 
   *            In this last case, the result cell comes also from at least one disconnecting bodies (see the next argument comment)

   *  @param oDisconnectingBodies
   *    The list of input disconnecting bodies subdividing the current original cell (third case of the previous argument comment)
   *    this list is empty in case of untouched cell, or simple modification of cell without any subdivision.
   *
   *  @param oDisconnectingOrientations
   *    list parallel to oDisconnectingBodies,
   *    associating a relative orientation to each disconnecting body crossing and subdividing the current original cell,
   *    in order to identify the half-space containing the current sub-cell from the current oriented disconnecting body
   *
