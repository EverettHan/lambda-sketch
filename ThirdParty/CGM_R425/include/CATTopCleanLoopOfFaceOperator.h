/**
 * Class defining the operator to clean (improve) the continuity of all the loops of a face.
 *
 * The cleaning consists in making exactly continuous the connections at vertices between
 * edges in each loop and in reducing the number of edges in each loop. A maximum deformation
 * between input loops and corrected loops is taken into account during the process.
 * The operator produces a new face, except if no cleaning has been necessary.
 *
 * The cleaning is controlled by the user of the operator. The operator is able to correct the
 * following defects without exceeding an input maximum authorized deformation :
 * - Point discontinuities at vertices between edges of a loop according to a distance 
 *   threshold. Each G0 discontinuity lesser than this threshold is corrected to provide
 *   exact G0 continuity.
 * - Tangency discontinuities between edges of a loop according to an angle threshold. Each
 *   G1 discontinuity lesser than this threshold is corrected to provide exact G1 continuity.
 * - Curvature discontinuities between edges of a loop according to a percentage threshold iCurvThres.
 *   Warning : The G2 discontinuity does not directly correspond to the curvature vector
 *   discontinuity : Let C1 and C2 be the curvature vectors to edges E1, E2 incident to vertex V.
 *   Let define R = |C1 - C2 | / max (|C1|,|C2|) to be the curvature vector ratio.
 *   If R is lesser than (1-iCurvThres)/iCurvThres, G2 disccontinuity is corrected 
 *   to provide exact G2 continuity (R=0).
 * - Small edges are removed according to an edge length criterion.
 * The default continuity level to correct is G2 continuity. Upon request, the user may change this
 * level.
 * More over after these corrections, the operator concatenates G2 continuous edges in order to
 * reduce the number of them. Upon request, the user may disable this treatment in order to keep
 * the same topology between each input loop and each corrected loop (one corrected edge
 * corresponding to one input edge).
 *
 * 
 * This operator follows the general scheme of the topological operators:
 * 
 * - Creates the operator with the CATCreateTopCleanLoopOfFaceOperator global function, which defines
 * the shell to clean the loops of.
 * - Sets the cleaning parameters
 * - Runs with the Run method. In case of maximum deformation control mode, if the operator does
 * not find any solution satisfying all the constraints, an error is thrown.
 * - Gets the result body by the GetResult method. 
 * The result body contains at most the same number of edges than the input one. Moreover, one
 * can access to the maximum deformation between the input body and the result.
 * - Deletes the operator with the usual C++ delete operator.
 *
