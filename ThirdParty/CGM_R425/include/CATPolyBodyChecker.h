/**
This class performs several consistency checks of the macro-topology and micro-topology of a CATPolyBody.
It checks if a CATPolyBody is valid or not. 

In some cases (like adapter cases), the discrete entities (surfaces, curves and points) may not satisfy all the properties and adjacency 
relationships required to belong to a CATPolyBody.   A CATPolyBody object may still be built with a valid
macro-topology (as it should always be) but the entities it refers to may fail some of the requirement tests.

Checks can be performed independently.  The check methods return <tt>S_OK</tt> if the CATPolyBody passes the test and 
<tt>S_FALSE</tt> if it fails the test.  A returned error (<tt>E_FAIL</tt> or any other code) means that the test could not
be completely performed or that the data structure has corrupted data.

The errors found during these checks will be logged onto the CATPolyBodyDiagnosis.
