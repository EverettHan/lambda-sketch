/**
 * Some situations do require scene management, for example in specific context
 * you might want reps annotated or you want an external manager independant
 * of VisuManager or SG itself to maintain information regarding the various
 * nodes of the graph to perform some preparation for the traversal. For all
 * these situation you can set a CATSGManager on the CATSGContext.
 *
 * Public interfaces needed for a class to act that way are related to streaming
 * so that the manager has some entry p√¥int to start working on things.
 * Below methods will be called automatically by DmuStreaming code if such a
 * manager is registered with the global SGManager. Interestingly this is only
 * the beginning as esquivalent insertion point would have to be provided for
 * Rep creation/destruction independantly of streaming.
 * TODO : See last comment above.
 * TODO2 : Way to many Reviver methods. Need to perform some cleanup when the solution
 * for model integration stabilize.
