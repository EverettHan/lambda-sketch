* <b>Role:</b> This operator produces a polyhedral CATBody
* while completing a ribbon shape along a guide wire,
* filling the spaces between successive sweep surfaces associated to guide edges.
* If the guide is an open wire, it's mandatory to associate sweep surfaces on the first and last edges.
* Fill surfaces will be computed between successive sweep surfaces, sharing a guide vertex or separated by guide edges.
* The guide can contain several domains but has to be manifold (no common vertices shared but several wires)
* This operator currently only works for polyhedral CATBody inputs.
