//
//   This fields are to write in understandable terms for the end user (no debug messages!)
//
//   These fields may be empty : if the error is not understandable in end user terms 
//   (no more possible explanation than "the action failed") these fields may be empty
//   This means that the PLM error is only dedicated to interpretration use. 
//
//   NLS parameters :
//   - have to be understandable by the end user
//   - NEVER indicate which PLM component is concerned by the error.
//     The PLM component concerned by the error is indicated with the CATComponentId associated to the error.
