  -create or -del       : To create or delete an environment file.
  -e EnvName            : Name of the environment to create or to delete (optional).
                          Default name is Env.
  -d EnvDirPath|INSTALL : Environment file storage folder (optional).
                          If not used, EnvDir = \"/p1\".
                          If -d INSTALL, EnvDir = \"/p2\".
                          If -d EnvDirPath, EnvDir = EnvDirPath.
  -p ConcatPath         : Concatenation path. Multiple paths can be specified (for creation only, optional).
                          Default value: \"/p3\".
                          When used with -from, adds ConcatPath to the installation path at the beginning.
  -from Env|EnvFullPath : To create a new environment file from an existing one (for creation only, optional).
                          You can give either the name of the environment or its full path.
                          For example: 
                             DSYEnvMgt -create -e Env2 -from \"/p2\Env.txt\" will create Env2.txt in \"/p1\".
                          or 
                             DSYEnvMgt -create -e Env2 -from Env -d INSTALL will create Env2.txt in \"/p2\".
  -append               : If used with -from and -p options, will add the ConcatPath at the end of the concatenation.
                          If not used, and -from and -p options are used, the ConcatPath will be added at the beginning of the concatenation.
